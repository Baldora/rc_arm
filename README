The project has been designed, and implemented, and is a tested system that uses a Raspberry Pi with a pan-and-tilt servo to track an object based on a Raspberry Pi Pico W with an MPU6050 sensor to provide x-y coordinates to allow for remote control of the the pan-and-tilt servo via a socket-based communication. 

For installation:
Install the ‘Pi’ file within the Raspberry Pi and run ‘main’. 
Install the ‘Pico W’ file on the Pico W and run ‘main’. 

All files are required on the relevant device for the project to run.
